				<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host enviornment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these enviroments to provied programmatic control over them.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="" class="link">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds the value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="example">var x;</span></li>	
					<li><a href=""class="link">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. the = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span class="example">var x =10;</span></li>	
					<li><a href=""class="link">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the datatype, There are six data typs that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="example">true</span> or <span class="example">false;</span> null- <span class="example">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="example">42</span> or <span class="example">3.141590;</span> String - <span class="example">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="example">[1, "Coding", 2, "Dojo"];</span> and Object - <span class="example">{first_name : 'Jane', last_name : 'Doe' }</span></li>
					<li><a href=""class="link">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to preform different actions for different decisions- hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="example">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="example">else if</span> to dpecify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="example">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
					<li><a href=""class="link">Loops</a> There are many different kinkds of loops in every programming language , but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
					<li><a href=""class="link">Functions</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, ew open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
